# iOS-Phrase-App
My first iPhone app that actually does something (even though it might not be much)...
The app let's a user enter a short phrase of their choice (up to 10 phrases) and displays them in a loop
with next/previous/random buttons. After 10 phrases are entered, the user may not enter any more.
